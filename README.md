# Word-a-Day

## Running the game

```bash
npm start
```

## Strategy

Default to native browser tools unless there's a justification for an outside tool.

### Value added

Wordle is missing the community competition of something like WordsWithFriends.
Leader boards with ranks and scores are missing. MVP will be a global leader board.
The Leader boards will have all-time, weekly, and daily scores.

### Future ideas

- [ ] Create leagues for select players to compete against each other.

## Justifications

### TypeScript

Type checking and static analysis is a good thing. While it may have a cost in development, it will save time in debugging and give confidence in stability.

### Pug

Requirement for project 2.
