# Word-a-Day

## Running the game

```bash
npm start
```

## Strategy

Default to native browser tools unless there's a justification for an outside tool.

## Justifications

### TypeScript

Type checking and static analysis is a good thing. While it may have a cost in development, it will save time in debugging and give confidence in stability.
